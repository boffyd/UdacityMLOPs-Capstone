# CAPTSONE PROJECT AZURE MACHINE LEARNING ENGINEER

This is the capstone project for the Azure Machine Learning Engineer where we put it all together and combine Machine Learning through the Azure platform to deploy a model.

## Project Set Up and Installation
Firstly to run models and environments in Azure you need a login.  In this case the UDACITY VM access point is used with a predifined login and access to compute resources.

## Dataset

### Overview
The dataset explored for this project is the Adult dataset, which is a banking classification problem trying to identify whether or not an individal earns more than 50k.  It consists of 14 Variables and 1 target variable (wage-outcome).  The file location can be found as per the below weblink.

### Task
*TODO*: Explain the task you are going to be solving with this dataset and the features you will be using for it.

### Access
*TODO*: Explain how you are accessing the data in your workspace.

## Automated ML
*TODO*: Give an overview of the `automl` settings and configuration you used for this experiment

### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your automated ML model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
*TODO*: What kind of model did you choose for this experiment and why? Give an overview of the types of parameters and their ranges used for the hyperparameter search


### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Model Deployment
*TODO*: Give an overview of the deployed model and instructions on how to query the endpoint with a sample input.

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:
- A working model
- Demo of the deployed  model
- Demo of a sample request sent to the endpoint and its response

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
